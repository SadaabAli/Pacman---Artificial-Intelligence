Heuristic for question 6:

To calculate the heuristic value for any state I do the following steps:
1) Calculate manhattan distance of the state from every corner
2) Remove the corner giving the least manhattan distance from the list of corners and make it the next state
3) Add the least manhattan distance to a variable "heuristicValue" which as initialized to 0
4) Repeat this process until the corner list becomes empty.
5) Return the heuristicValue
6) Return zero if the state is one the corners.

Heuristic for question 7:

To calculate the heuristic value for any state I do the following steps:

1) Calculate the maze distance of the state from every food position.
2) Return the maze distance which gives the maximum distance from the state.
3) Return zero if the state contains the food.

Note:
I spent 12-14 hours for the assignment.
